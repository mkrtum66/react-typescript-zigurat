This follows a similar model to traditional crowdfunding platforms though funders should note it is potentially gameable by sending one\'s own funds to the contract in order to meet the target and release funds. With all crowdfunding - there is a significant risk that the fundraiser doesn;t deliver on their goals. In a traditional model, this simply means the promised perks will never be delivered. With the Zigurat model - the tokenised representation of the future perks are delivered immediately - and whilst their ultimate utility still requires the fundraiser to deliver on their promises, the ability to buy and sell these tokens on an open market means that funders have more visibility over the process. In addition, fundraisers may choose to create their own treasury of such tokens to be released at future dates which will likely incentivise them to continue to add value to their project.',
